# Computer-Vision-Assisted-UAV-detection-and-tracking
This System track the Flaying object and Detect the object using various Machine learning algoritm like Support vector maching,KNN,Random forest and convoluted Neural network.

details of the project
1. we have used Kalman filter to detect and  track the Object
2.then the system crope the object image.
3.classify the oject using various Maching learning classifiers
4.wehave used Random forest,KNN,SVM,Nureal network.
5.project work with 87% accuracy using CNN.

Thank You
